# JavaScript Graph Exercise

This exercise goes along with the [Graph lesson in the Computer Science Curriculum](https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-3/04-graphs.md)

Run `npm install` then `mocha` to run the tests.

You'll be updating `graph.js` to:
* Calculate the size of the graph
* Calculate the number of edges in the graph
* Calculate the total weight of all nodes in the graph
* Given a value, find all neighbors of the node with the given value
* Given two values, find a path between them (array of nodes)
* Find all nodes in the graph that have no edges connecting them
